# AgentDesk

Delegates coding tasks to Claude agents, choosing the cheapest model that can do each one,
across any number of projects and Claude accounts, with a dashboard to follow progress and spend
and a chat to talk to.

## Install (any computer)

Needs **Python 3.11+** and **git**. Copy this folder anywhere, then:

- Windows: right-click `install.ps1` → *Run with PowerShell* (or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1`)
- macOS / Linux: `sh install.sh`

The Claude command-line tool comes bundled with the SDK; nothing else to install.

**Start:** double-click `AgentDesk.cmd` (Windows) or run `./agentdesk.sh`. The dashboard opens in its own
window titled "AgentDesk" (pywebview; no browser tab). The server runs in the background with no console
window at http://127.0.0.1:8765, reachable from this computer only. Closing the window does not stop the
server or runs; start again to get a window back, or use Quit / `stop`. Size and position are remembered
under `[window]` in `data/settings.toml` (existing values are only updated when the window closes). If the
window can't start (e.g. no WebView2), the error goes to `data/agentdesk.log` and the browser opens instead.
`python -m agentdesk dashboard --browser` always uses a browser tab; `--no-browser` only serves. Runs started from the dashboard are detached too, so they keep going if the dashboard
is closed. Output goes to `runner.log` (runs) and `data/agentdesk.log` (dashboard when started in the background).

**Stop:** `AgentDesk.cmd stop` (or `./agentdesk.sh stop`, `python -m agentdesk stop`) ends the dashboard
(PID in `data/dashboard.pid`). Add `--runs` to also stop runs started from the dashboard.

## Moving to another computer

Copy the whole folder (with `data/`) and run the installer there; the `.venv` folder can be left
out, since the installer rebuilds it. Repository paths in `data/projects/*/project.toml` may need
editing if the repos live elsewhere on the new computer. Logins (`data/logins/`) are per computer
by nature: press **Log in** again there. To keep the data somewhere else (e.g. a synced folder),
set the `AGENTDESK_HOME` environment variable to that folder.

## Accounts

Sidebar → Accounts → **+ Add**:
- **Claude subscription**: a separate login kept in its own folder. Press **Log in**; a console
  opens; type `/login` and sign in with that account. The account named `default` uses your
  normal Claude Code login.
- **API key**: name an environment variable (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_WORK`) holding the key. AgentDesk
  reads it when it starts and never stores keys.

Each project uses one account (chosen when adding it; changeable in its `project.toml`). The
usage gauge is per account: runs pause when the account's usage reaches the threshold.

## Projects

Sidebar → Projects → **+ Add**: name, the repository folder (a git repo), the branch tasks start
from, a checks preset (Rust, Node, Python, Go, none) and the account. The checks run after every
attempt; edit them in `data/projects/<project>/project.toml` (`[gates] quick` after each attempt,
`final` on demand; `[gates.env]` environment for them).

## How work flows

1. You add tasks: **+ Task**, or describe the work to the project's assistant in the chat (it
   writes the task for you).
2. **Run next** / **Run all**: a cheap router (Haiku) reads the task and the repo, picks a tier
   and writes a brief. The worker — Haiku (mechanical), Sonnet (standard) or Opus at high effort
   (hard) — does it in its own git worktree on branch `auto/<id>`, never touching your checkout.
3. AgentDesk runs the checks itself (no model tokens). Failures go back to the worker, trimmed;
   after two failed attempts the task moves up a tier; after the top tier it's marked blocked.
4. Green work is committed on its branch. Nothing is ever pushed, released or published:
   you review the `auto/*` branches and merge what you want.

Limits: a budget per call and per run, and a pause at the account's usage threshold
(`data/settings.toml`, `[limits]`). Workers can't push, change remotes, publish or edit outside
their worktree (`[guard]`).

## Command line

```
AgentDesk.cmd projects                     (or ./agentdesk.sh …)
AgentDesk.cmd add-project NAME REPO BASE --preset rust --account default
AgentDesk.cmd status PROJECT
AgentDesk.cmd run PROJECT [TASK] [--max N]
AgentDesk.cmd plan PROJECT [TASK]
AgentDesk.cmd final PROJECT TASK
AgentDesk.cmd import NAME OLD_ORCHESTRATOR_DIR
```
